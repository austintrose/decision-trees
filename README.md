# Decision Trees

Some smart people over at the University of Alberta created this cool [Decision Trees exploration](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~aixplore/learning/DecisionTrees/) several years ago. There's a bunch of great information there, as well as a nifty Java Applet to play with.

Java Applets have become a bit dated and insecure since then, though. Plus, HTML has evolved and CSS was invented! This is a project to migrate the content of that Decision Trees exploration to a more modern looking site, and also to serve the Applet as pure AJAX rendering with the help of AjaxSwing.

Static site work in progress: http://development.decision-trees.divshot.io/

Applet deployed with AjaxSwing (no client-side Java needed):
